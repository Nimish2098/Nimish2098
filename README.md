Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nimish Rao!!
I'm a Machine Learning enthusiast, passionate about staying on top of cutting-edge trends in AI and Data Science. My focus is on applying modern machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems and explore the possibilities of intelligent systems.

Current trends I'm excited about:

Generative AI & Large Language Models (LLMs): Experimenting with GPT, BERT, and other transformer-based models to enhance language understanding and content generation.
AI in Computer Vision: Implementing CNNs, YOLO, and other object detection models to drive advancements in visual recognition and autonomous systems.
AI Ethics & Fairness: Exploring tools and frameworks that promote bias mitigation and ethical AI practices in model development.
AutoML & MLOps: Leveraging tools like AutoML and MLFlow to automate model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and efficient deployment pipelines.
Reinforcement Learning: Investigating the use of RL in dynamic environments like robotics and game simulations.
Iâ€™m actively working on projects that focus on these emerging areas. Feel free to explore my repositories to see my latest work and join the conversation on the future of AI!
